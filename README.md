# What is Coordinated Navigation?

Coordinated Navigation is a Swift library that enables **navigating** between screens using a navigation **tree structure** where every node doesnâ€™t need to know each other.

Implemented in SwiftUI (using iOS 16 **Navigation Stack**) following the **Coordinator Pattern** approach.

## Why?

As a developer I've faced many projects where the navigation logic is not structured in a way where navigation funnels can be reused in a flexible way. That's why I came up with a **Tree Structure** solution.

![Example](./ExampleCoordinatorsApp.jpg)

Organizing our navigation into a Tree, where we have branch nodes (sequence coordinators) and leaf nodes (screen coordinators) allows us to isolate funnels with its own transitions, and reuse them wherever we need.

For example let's assume we need an Authentication funnel which consists of showing a Login Screen and then possible navigations (pushes) to a Register Screen or to a Forgotten Password Screen.

![Authentication](./ExampleAuthenticationSequence.png)

Isolating this funnel in an Authentication Sequence coordinator allows us to push this funnel into an existing Navigation Stack (horizontal navigation) and also to present it modally (vertical navigation).

Without this library this specific behaviour is challenging due how SwiftUI works internally, as the horizontal navigation in SwiftUI involves modifyng the NavigationStack's path and the vertical navigation involves adding a sheet or a fullscreen modifier into the current SwiftUI view.

This library allows us to concatenate sequences into our NavigationStack without having to deal with its internal path modifications. Each sequence can be managed by itself and performs its own transitions resulting in a decoupled Tree Structure.

Also, the Tree Structure forces the coordinators to always be responsible of their **own funnel** and their **direct children** only. This helps us to follow the **single responsibility principle** in our navigation.

## How it works?

In order to arrange our views and navigation logic into a tree structure we will use different Coordinator objects. 

- Screen Coordinator
- Sequence Coordinator
- Stack Coordinator

### Screen Coordinator

A Screen Coordinator contains and shows a plain SwiftUI view.

- It's configured using a SwiftUI view. Via init or set.
- In our tree structure is a Leaf node. That means is **NOT** able to push or pop to other screens (NO horizontal navigation).
- It can present other Coordinators modally/fullscreen (vertical navigation).

Benefits of using a coordinator for a simple screen/view?

- We avoid the view struct knowing about Domain scope.
- The same coordinator can set different views (example: one for iPad and one for iPhone).
- Depending of our architecture the coordinator may be in charge of holding a reference to a Presenter or a ViewModel. Or even be used as the ObservableObject for the view.
- Serves as a good abstraction when working with modules. Clients will know about the existance of a ScreenCoordinator only, but not which view/presentation classes are being used inside.

### Sequence Coordinator

A Sequence Coordinator is just a piece of logic that manages navigation between different Screens or Sequences in a horizontal navigation. It can **PUSH, POP or SET** two types of coordinators:

- Sequence Coordinators (branch nodes)
- Screen Coordinators (leaf nodes)

When a coordinator is pushed or setted, it's added as a child coordinator of the Sequence. As a Sequence Coordinator can add other Sequence Coordinators, this ends up creating the tree structure. Sequence Coordinators can update their own children whenever is required (push, pop or set) and the navigation tree will be updated automatically.

### Stack Coordinator
A Stack Coordinator shows a NavigationStack view (horizontal navigation).

- It's used as the entry point of the app or a modal presentation.
- Can only **SET or POP** a Sequence.

In order to show the content of the tree structure a Sequence Coordinator (root of the tree) must be setted into an Stack Coordinator. This will unwrap the tree content inside a NavigationStack view. It will show all the pushed Screen Coordinators (leaf nodes) as if we perform a **Depth-first search** in the tree. It will animate the changes automatically (same as if we were using a NavigationStack or a UINavigationController but respecting the current tree structure).

## How to use:

Here you can find some examples about how to use the library.

### Creating a simple Screen Coordinator

Let's start creating a simple SwfitUI view named **TitleView**. This view receives a title string and sets a Text in the middle of the screen and also sets the navigationTitle, this way if we use it into an Stack the navigation title will be shown as well.

```
import SwiftUI
import CoordinatedNavigation

struct TitleView: View {

    let title: String

    init(title: String) {
        self.title = title
    }

    var body: some View {
        Text(title)
            .navigationTitle(title)
    }
}
```

Now that we have a TitleView, as an example, let's create one with the title "Splash Screen". Let's create its own Screen Coordinator using one of the next approaches:

```
// 1. Using the default screen coordinator.
let screenCoordinator: ScreenCoordinator = DefaultScreenCoordinator(view: TitleView(title: "Splash Screen"))

// 2. Using the default screen coordinator sugar method.
let screenCoordinator: ScreenCoordinator = TitleView(title: "Splash Screen").toScreenCoordinator()

// 3. Creating a custom screen coordinator in case we want a more complex lifecycle.
class SplashScreenCoordinator: ScreenCoordinator {
    let navigationComponent = ScreenCoordinatorComponent()

    init() {
        navigationComponent.setView(TitleView(title: "Splash Screen"))
    }
}

let screenCoordinator: ScreenCoordinator = SplashScreenCoordinator()
```

### Creating a Sequence Coordinator

Let's create the previous example Authentication Sequence. The Sequence will start showing a Login Screen and then, from this screen, the user can navigate to a Register Screen or to a Forgot Password Screen.

First, we create the example Login View (Login screen).

```
struct LoginView: View {

    // Navigation is never done in the view, it's always delegated to the parent sequence (in this case using a closure).
    enum Output {
        case registerButtonPressed
        case forgotPasswordButtonPressed
    }

    let output: (Output) async -> Void

    // Assume we are using a view model or whatever you need to keep your state and your behaviour
    @State private var username: String = ""
    @State private var password: String = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 16.0) {
            TextField("Username", text: $username)
            SecureField("Password", text: $password)

            Button("Login") {
                // Assume an internal logic is called (no navigation needed)
            }

            Button("Register") {
                Task { await output(.registerButtonPressed) }
            }

            Button("Forgot password?") {
                Task { await output(.forgotPasswordButtonPressed) }
            }

            Spacer()
        }
        .navigationTitle("Login screen")
    }
}

```

For the Register screen and the Forgot Password screen examples we will use the previous TitleView.

Now let's create the Sequence that defines the navigation between them. The library is really flexible so we can create it using two different approaches:

1: Using the Default Sequence Coordinator class.

```
func createAuthenticationSequenceCoordinator() async -> SequenceCoordinator {
    let sequenceCoordinator = DefaultSequenceCoordinator()

    let loginScreen = await LoginView(output: { action in
        switch action {
        case .registerButtonPressed:
            let registerScreen = await TitleView(title: "Register screen").toScreenCoordinator()
            await sequenceCoordinator.navigationComponent.push(screen: registerScreen)
        case .forgotPasswordButtonPressed:
            let forgotPasswordScreen = await TitleView(title: "Forgot password screen").toScreenCoordinator()
            await sequenceCoordinator.navigationComponent.push(screen: forgotPasswordScreen)
        }
    }).toScreenCoordinator()

    await sequenceCoordinator.navigationComponent.set(screen: loginScreen)

    return sequenceCoordinator
}

let authenticationSequenceCoordinator = await createAuthenticationSequenceCoordinator()
```

2: Creating a Custom Sequence Coordinator class.

```
class AuthenticationSequenceCoordinator: SequenceCoordinator {
    let navigationComponent = SequenceCoordinatorComponent()

    init() async {
        await navigationComponent.set(screen: createLoginScreen())
    }

    func createLoginScreen() async -> ScreenCoordinator {
        await LoginView(output: { action in
            switch action {
            case .registerButtonPressed:
                await self.navigationComponent.push(screen: self.createRegisterScreen())
            case .forgotPasswordButtonPressed:
                await self.navigationComponent.push(screen: self.createForgotPasswordScreen())
            }
        }).toScreenCoordinator()
    }

    func createRegisterScreen() async -> ScreenCoordinator {
        await TitleView(title: "Register screen").toScreenCoordinator()
    }

    func createForgotPasswordScreen() async -> ScreenCoordinator {
        await TitleView(title: "Forgot password screen").toScreenCoordinator()
    }
}

let authenticationSequenceCoordinator = await AuthenticationSequenceCoordinator()
```


### Creating a Stack Coordinator

Once we have a sequence coordinator implemented, the Stack Coordinator is the one in charge of creates the root view (which uses a SwiftUI Navigation Stack internally) and holds the tree structure.

In the following example we will use the previous AuthenticationSequenceCoordinator as our root.

```
func createRootStackCoordinator() async -> StackCoordinator {
    let authenticationSequenceCoordinator = await createAuthenticationSequenceCoordinator()
    return await DefaultStackCoordinator(sequenceCoordinator: authenticationSequenceCoordinator)
}
```

Then we can use the StackCoordinator as a SwiftUI view, calling the `getView()` method. For example we can call it from our AppDelegate or our WindowGroup. As we are using async/await to keep up to date with the new iOS concurrency checks the library provides a loading view (AsyncViewCoordinator) so we can initialize our view in a safe way while we show an Splash screen.

```
@main
struct ExampleApp: App {

    let mainCoordinator: ViewCoordinator

    init() {
        mainCoordinator = AsyncViewCoordinator(loadingView: TitleView(title: "Splash Screen")) {
            // Initialization time (simulates long operation)
            try! await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(2))
            await createRootStackCoordinator()
        }
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            mainCoordinator.getView()
        }
    }
}
```
